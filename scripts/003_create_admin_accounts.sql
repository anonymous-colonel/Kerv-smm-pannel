-- Create default admin and subadmin accounts
-- Note: These will be created through the application signup flow with proper password hashing

-- This script is for reference only
-- The actual admin accounts will be created via the signup API with:
-- Super Admin: username=admin, password=kerventz2005
-- Sub Admin: username=subadmin, password=admin1234

-- After signup, we'll update their roles manually or through admin panel
